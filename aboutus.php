            <p class="page-content">
                Friendly Ballot is a service that aids users to build secure and cloud-based electronic voting
                systems
                and facilitates the voters to cast the secure and secret ballot online, without any hassle.
                Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic when everything, including government procedures have moved online, the
                creators at Friendly Ballot decided to work towards creating a user-friendly election and voting
                system,
                so that it eases the stress around the manual voting for the important and unavoidable elections.
                Voters
                can vote at their own convenience and in the comfort of their home.

        <h1 class="content-head-1">Goals</h1>
        <p>Friendly Ballot was created in 2020 as a part of two students' computer engineering project. The goals
            that were aimed to be achieved through Friendly Ballot:-</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide the best kind of experience for ballor administrators, candidates and voters. Getting voters
                    to cast vote is challenging and that is why Friendly Ballot exhibits a friendly user interface.
                    Friendly Ballot is not only fast, but also works great with mobile devices.</li>
                    <li>Provide high security and reliability to the ballot administrators. The administrators can manually
                        identify the valid and invalid votes using the organization ID that is entered by the users while
                        registering or voting for a ballot.</li>
                        <li>Voter privacy is maintained and not even the ballor administrator can see to whom the vote is cast,
                            hence making Friendly Ballot a secret ballot too.</li>
                            <li>Friendly Ballot is cost effective, in fact, it is completely free! Anyone, in any part of the world,
                                can create a ballot for the smallest purpose like a school election, or for a larger purpose like
                                the General Elections to the Parliament houses.</li>
                                <li>Promote better voting techniques, whilst maintaining the integrity imposed by the good old secret
                                    ballot.</li>
                                    <li>Since human brain is the best machine, to maintain transparency, the
                                        administrator can manually accept or
                                        deny votes cast by voters to make sure unfair practices do not creep in.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                                    We met at Thadomal Shahani Engineering College, Bandra in 2018.
                                                    As students of Computer Engineering both of us have always been passionate about the various
                                                    applications related to web and software development.
                                                    Web technology has always attracted both of ours attention as they run across a large
                                                    variety of
                                                    devices without any separate programming for each.
                                                    Apart from web technology, we have been invloved in Java programmming, competitive coding as
                                                    well as mobile application development.
